This is a placeholder for the video poster image.
In a real implementation, you would place an actual JPG image here that serves as the thumbnail for the video.
The poster should show:
- Patient Smart Card logo
- Professional healthcare imagery
- Clear title text
- Appealing design that encourages clicks

For now, the video will show a default browser poster or you can replace this with an actual image file.
